# Landing Page Development - Internship Task 1

## Project Overview

This repository contains the solution for **Task 1: Landing Page Development** as part of my Full Stack Web Development Internship. The objective was to create a simple, responsive, and visually appealing landing page using HTML and CSS. [cite: 1]

The project demonstrates fundamental front-end development skills, focusing on responsive design, clear user interaction, and a modern aesthetic.

## Features

* **Responsive Design:** The landing page is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices, thanks to implemented media queries. [cite: 1, 12]
* **Hero Section:** A prominent hero section with a large heading, a compelling short description, and a clear "Get Started" Call-to-Action (CTA) button to engage visitors. [cite: 1, 4]
* **Dropdown Navigation:** An interactive navigation bar featuring dropdown menus for "Features" and "Services," enhancing user interaction and providing smooth access to content. [cite: 1, 3, 8, 9]
* **Key Features Section:** Displays a grid of key product or service features with brief descriptions, showcasing the offerings. [cite: 1, 5]
* **Footer:** Includes essential copyright information, privacy policy, and terms of service links. [cite: 1, 6]
* **Visually Appealing Layout:** Utilizes a clean, modern color scheme, readable fonts, and effective use of margins, padding, and Flexbox for a well-structured and appealing layout. [cite: 1, 10, 11, 12]
* **Enhanced Navigation Experience:** Hover effects are implemented for a smooth user experience, ensuring easy clickability and tap-friendliness for all links. [cite: 1, 13, 14]
